## Notes

Because of other assignments, I didn't give any focus to the design of this app from a stylistic perspective. I made sure to give this app the best functionality it could, having to tweak many parts of the provided code from CodePath. Some errors caused complete dysfunction, though, which weren't detrimental but unexpected coming from the direct source of information.
